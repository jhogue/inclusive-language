          <textarea class="display__input" name="" id="input-area">Avoid gendered pronouns like he and she unless you are sure how someone identifies. As for someone’s preferred pronouns before using them. 
Stop using phrases like the opposite sex, it suggests there is only the binary. The phrase “biological” men or women is hurtful because it suggests there are  gender experiences that are more normal than others. Born a woman is the same thing. And don’t use someone’s dead name with phrases like [he/she/they] went by.
Marketers use the phrase target audience quite a bit, and may not realize it has violent undertones. 
Gender is a personal and societal construct, not one which is absolute based on whether someone was born male or born a girl.
Generally checking if new term highlighting is working like able bodied or acting gay or being abnormal or African-American or how about A.D. 2500 AD 2500. 
Empty lines throw an error :(.</textarea>

        <p><i>What is this?</i> This is an educational tool that helps people become more mindful about their words, because <b>words matter</b>. Many words in this database may not be hurtful, upsetting, retraumatizing, or offensive to many people — but they might be to some. You’re not a bad person if you have used some language highlighted here, but if you have the cognitive/language privilege to adjust and learn, it’s worthwhile to consider becoming more aware/conscious of how everyday language helps perpetuate racism, sexism, genderism, ageism, and ableist ideas.</p>
