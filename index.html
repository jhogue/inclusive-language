Avoid gendered pronouns like he and she unless you are sure how someone identifies. Ask for someone’s pronouns or neo-pronouns before using a specific gender — otherwise, use the non-binary. 

Stop using phrases like the opposite sex, it suggests there is only the binary. The phrase “biological” men or women is hurtful because it suggests there are gender experiences that are more normal than others. Born a woman is the same thing. And don’t use someone’s dead name with phrases like [he/she/they] went by. Gender is a personal and societal construct, not one which is absolute based on whether someone was born male or born a girl.

Marketers use the phrase target audience quite a bit, and may not realize it has violent undertones. Same with real estate terms like master bedroom which connotes slavery.</textarea>

        <p><i>What is this?</i> This is an educational tool that helps people become more mindful about their words, because <b>words matter</b>. Many words in this database may not be hurtful, upsetting, retraumatizing, or offensive to many people — but they might be to some. You’re not a bad person if you have used some language highlighted here, but if you have the cognitive/language privilege to adjust and learn, it’s worthwhile to consider becoming more aware/conscious of how everyday language helps perpetuate racism, sexism, genderism, ageism, and ableist ideas.</p>
