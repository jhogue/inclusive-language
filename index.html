          <textarea class="display__input" name="" id="input-area">Avoid gendered pronouns like he and she unless you are sure how someone identifies. As for someone’s preferred pronouns before using them. 
Stop using phrases like the opposite sex, it suggests there is only the binary. The phrase “biological” men or women is hurtful because it suggests there are  gender experiences that are more normal than others. Born a woman is the same thing. And don’t use someone’s dead name with phrases like [he/she/they] went by.
Empty lines throw an error :(.</textarea>
